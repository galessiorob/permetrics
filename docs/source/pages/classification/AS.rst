In the multi-class and multi-label case, this is the average of the AS score of each class with weighting depending on the average parameter.

+ Best possible score is 1.0, higher value is better. Range = [0, 1]

Example:

.. code-block:: python
	:emphasize-lines: 11,13-16

	from numpy import array
	from permetrics.classification import ClassificationMetric

	## For integer labels or categorical labels
	y_true = [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0]
	y_pred = [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]

	# y_true = ["cat", "ant", "cat", "cat", "ant", "bird", "bird", "bird"]
	# y_pred = ["ant", "ant", "cat", "cat", "ant", "cat", "bird", "ant"]

	cm = ClassificationMetric(y_true, y_pred, decimal = 5)

	print(cm.accuracy_score())
	print(cm.accuracy_score(average="micro"))
	print(cm.AS(average="macro"))
	print(cm.AS(average="weighted"))
